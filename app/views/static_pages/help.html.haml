      There really isn't much that you shouldn't know on this app. You sign up, or sign in. Goto your profile, then your home page to create and check posts from people you are following. Simple as that. You can also set up a user icon by creating a
      \#{link_to "Gravatar", "http://en.gravatar.com/", target: "_blank"}
      account with the same e-mail address you used to create your
      %b @you
      account.
